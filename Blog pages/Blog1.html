                Hi! I'm Deb. I thought I would start My Blog with an introduction. First, I'm definately not a writer. Sorry about that, but here goes... I started coding last year when I signed up for a Bootcamp and WOW... That was an experience. I lasted 10 weeks and fought with myself to not give up and quit because I really wanted to take this oportunity to learn Web development. But, It was just so fast. I felt that this was not condusive to my learning style and would lead me to failure so reluctantly I decided to leave and search for a slower paced course. Turns out there are none. or none that I could find in a classroom. I left bootcamp feeling like I had failed and a little deflated and dissapointed with myself, so after a little break I've gotten back up, dusted myself off, and Im ready to go again. This time I'm teaching myself, with the help of Udemy of course. It's going to get tough and that is the main reason for this Blog. I want to document my journey, all the ups and downs so I can see my progression and hopefully help someone else out there who does not know how to get started.

                I recently read a book by Austin Cleon Titled
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=show+your+work+austin+kleon&crid=2DRGDV6143G36&sprefix=show+your+work+%2Caps%2C334&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_15">"Show your work"</a>.
                                                                                                                                        He goes through all the reason why we should show people the process of our creativity or a journey to aquireing a skill and that people want to see the artist paint, and not just see the finished piece.
