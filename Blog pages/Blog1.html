                Hi! I'm Deb. I thought I would start My Blog with an introduction. First, I'm definately not a writer. Sorry about that, but here goes... I started coding last year when I signed up for a Bootcamp and WOW... That was an experience. I lasted 10 weeks and fought with myself to not give up and quit because I really wanted to take this oportunity to learn Web development. But, It was just so fast. I felt that this was not condusive to my learning style and would lead me to failure so reluctantly I decided to leave and search for a slower paced course. Turns out there are none. or none that I could find in a classroom. I left the bootcamp feeling like I had failed and a little deflated and dissapointed with myself so after a little break I've gotten back up, dusted myself off and Im ready to go again. This time I'm teaching myself, with the help of Udemy of course. It's going to get tough and that is the main reason for this Blog. I want to document my journey so I can see my progression and hopefully build a community of people learning to code too.</p>
